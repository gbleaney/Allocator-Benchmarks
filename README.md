BDE Allocator Benchmarks
===
This repository contains a snapshot of the [BDE libraries](http://github.com/bloomberg/bde), and contains both allocator benchmarking tools and some modifications to the BDE libraries required
for those benchmark tools. This copy of BDE should not be used for any other purpose, as it is not kept up to date with the primary version.

Information about the allocator benchmarking tools is located [here](benchmarks/allocators).
